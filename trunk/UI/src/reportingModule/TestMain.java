It is about after authentication getting the profile details of the specific user. So I had to connect to the remote web service through the local server. In that case we all have to follow the same protocol that all had been agreed. So I got the WSDL file and created the java stub class to communicate with remote web service. I have done implementing all stuffs in this week. The return object is a JSON. So I got to know about JSON and how to serialize and de-serialize it. Using goggling I got a good idea. So as I expect itâ€™s going fine.","I was provided reading materials on Subversion by project mentors. In addition to that existing projects of subversion visualization were studied. Then I was introduced the JIRA system. 1st iteration of the project was scheduled in the meeting with project mentors. It was to display an image of a repository. Then task breakdown in JIRA was done according to 1st iteration.In that case we all have to follow the same protocol that all had been agreed.
